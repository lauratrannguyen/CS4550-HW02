8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/) 
For the most part, yes

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any? The
javascript portion made me question my sanity, but I managed to get it so I’m
satisfied. I kept on forgetting that event listeners take in a function without
the (), so debugging took me a while. Also my text editor is on my Mac and not
linux, so I had to email myself the code a lot to copy and paste into the
terminal.
